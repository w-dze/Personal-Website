        Here is a screenshot of a video I made for an English class for a project called Informed Citizen. I picked the topic of screen time tracking and decided to make a video to present my final research findings.

        I made an app on the right for the AP Create Performance Task on <a href = "https://code.org/">Code.org</a> This is a little app meant to help me in chemistry class. It will allow users to save time finding chemical elements on the periodic table. You can access the <a href = "https://studio.code.org/projects/applab/A2pLgTIYWTnhdKc571rB_K6t9r0bI_74YmAB6Nok8aA">app</a> here

        Here is the <a href = "https://wendys-personality-quiz.wendydu1.repl.co/">Personality Quiz</a>I made during Girls Who Code's Summer Immersion Program along with this website you are currently looking at. This is my first time using JavaScript to change something on a website. I spend a lot of time on picking the colors and making the buttons be more interactive.
